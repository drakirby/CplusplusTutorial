C++ History

In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, while doing work for his thesis, used the programming language Simula, which was the first language to support object-oriented programming. Inspired and wanting more, he created “C with Classes,” which was a superset of the C language. He wanted to add object-oriented programming to C, including classes, inheritance, inlining, and default function arguments. In 1983, “C with Classes” was changed to C++.
C++ is a general-purpose programming language, but is used primarily for system programming, software, and applications, including video games, servers, databases, and space probes.

Getting Started

I had some issues installing the language. I initially wanted to use VSCode, so I installed some build tools for that and attempted to use the compiler MinGW. Unfortunately, even after doing extensive research about the PATH and how to build C++, VSCode for some reason would not accept my pathing (I’ll figure it out eventually). After days of frustration, I downloaded the IDE Eclipse. Luckily, I could use MinGW with Eclipse. I was easily able to get it set up, and run my first Hello World.
Visual Studio (VSCode) is the primary IDE for C++, which is why I wanted to use it first. Other programming environments that people use for C++ are Eclipse (of course), Code:: Blocks, CLion, CodeLite, Apache NetBeans, Qt Creator, among others.
I’ve included sources below in the Works Cited that I used to set up C++ myself, to write this article, and to use in the future.

Running Code

To run a C++ program in Eclipse, you need to right click the project name in Project Explorer, select “Build Project.” Once it’s built, you right-click the project name in the Project Explorer and click “Run as.” Then, select “Local C/C++ Application.” Then, it runs!
To write comments, you simply use two forward slashes: //

Here, I explore several data types: int, string, double, bool, array, maps, and pointers.

Here's how you define each of these data types:

  int integer_example = 3;
  
	string string_example = "hello";

	double double_example = 3.3;

	bool bool_example = true;

	string array_example[3] = {"array", "example", "okay"};

	map<char, int> map_example;
	map_example['a'] = 0;
	map_example['b'] = 1;
	map_example['c'] = 2;

	string* pointer_example = &string_example;
  
Notes for discussion:

1. The naming convention for variables is to do all lowercase with underscores separating the words. Naming conventions are not enforced by the compiler,
   but are standards in the community.
2. C++ is dynamically typed, which means you can redefine a variable after it's already been typed.
3. There's a lot in the debate in the community about this, but I believe that C++ is strongly typed, because it stops you from making variable assignment mistakes
   (i.e., making a string var carry an int) in the compiling stage.
4. For example, int x = "5" + 6 would not work, for reasons stated above. You'd have to remove the quotation marks.
5. Maps are difficult here, because you have to use a for loop to iterate in order to get data out of the map. I don't go over this here. Additionally, for strings and maps,
   you have to have an #include statement at the top.
6. Other than map and pointer, these data types don't seem too complex or new, as compared to Java or Python, for example.

#C++ History:

In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, while doing work for his thesis, used the programming language Simula, which was the first language to support object-oriented programming. Inspired and wanting more, he created “C with Classes,” which was a superset of the C language. He wanted to add object-oriented programming to C, including classes, inheritance, inlining, and default function arguments. In 1983, “C with Classes” was changed to C++.<br/>
C++ is a general-purpose programming language, but is used primarily for system programming, software, and applications, including video games, servers, databases, and space probes.

#Getting Started:

You'll need to install a compiler, like Cygwin or MinGW. I used MinGW, which can be found here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/
You'll also need to install an IDE. Visual Studio (VSCode) is the primary IDE for C++. Other programming environments that people use for C++ are
Eclipse, Code:: Blocks, CLion, CodeLite, Apache NetBeans, Qt Creator, among others.<br/>
I installed Eclipse, which can be found here: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

#Running Code:

You'll need to make a New Project, and then within that new project, create a New File with the ending .cpp.

To run a C++ program in Eclipse, you need to right click the project name in Project Explorer, select “Build Project.” Once it’s built, you right-click the project name in the Project Explorer and click “Run as.” Then, select “Local C/C++ Application.”<br/>
To write comments, you simply use two forward slashes: //
